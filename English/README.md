# Discord.js introduction

** Discord.js ** is a node.js module that allows you to interact with the Discord API. It takes a much more object-oriented approach than most other JS Discord libraries, making the code significantly neater and easier to understand.

In the `Adonys Bot` folder there is an example of a Simple Bot.

In the folder `Lessons` the creation and configuration of the bot is explained step by step.

## What do you need?

1. A code editor `(VS Code, Vim, etc.)`
2. The Node Package Manager (npm).
3. A server to publish the bot `(Heroku, Replit, etc.)`
4. Eager to learn.
